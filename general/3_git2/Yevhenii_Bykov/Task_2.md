# Task_2
## `Merge`:
I've commited in `master` and in branch `new`. After that i merged these branches 
and got the result with commits sorted by date of commiting.

## Conclusions:
1. I like the most `merge`, i think it's more simple. 
2. When you are working alone on branch you can use `rebase`, in other situation `merge` is better.
