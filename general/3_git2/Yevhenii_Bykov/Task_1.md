# Task_1
### Task1_1
I added text in `file_name.txt` in branch Yujiniy and commited it. 
Made the same in main. 
Tried to merge Yujinit and got `CONFLICT`.

To save local changes we need to remove remote changes.

### Task1_2
I did the same thing.
But tried to merge main and also got `CONFLICT`

### Task1_3
To save the changes from both branches it is not necessary to remove anything. All that is needed is to simply put local and remote changes in the correct order.
