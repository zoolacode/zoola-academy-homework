# Homework for GIT 2 Lesson

## Instructions (PLEASE, READ THIS BEFORE YOU BEGIN)

1. Create your directory `Name-Surname` INSIDE this package (for ex. general/3_git2/Ivan-Ivanov).
2. Results for each task MUST be submitted in separate MD files.
3. Complete your work LOCALLY and submit ONLY files with results and without any test commits.
4. Each result file MUST contain: 
   1. brief description of completed work; 
   2. git commands that were used;
   3. screenshots for each step (that you think is important);
   4. conclusions.
5. Each result must be written in English.

In this homework I'll be looking closely at:
- names of branches;
- names of remote repo;
- messages in commits;
- etc.

Keep your work as clean as possible.


## Tasks

### Task 0: Setting up remote repo

Task is simple as it is.

1. Create new public repo in github.
2. Set it up both remote and local.
3. Create new branch.
4. Create text file with your name and surname.
5. Commit it.
6. Push your branch.
7. Make sure your .gitignore file exists :) and you did not push any unnecessary files.
8. Show the git logs.
9. Do not forget to attach a link to your repo in results.

### Task 1: Solving conflicts

Use the same remote github repo from previous task.
The task is to create conflicts. 3 times.

1. First time – accept local changes instead of remote.
2. Second time – accept remote changes instead of local.
3. Third time – accept both.


### Task 2: Merge vs Rebase

Integrate changes from one branch into another branch using:
1. git merge.
2. git rebase.

Post your screenshots (use git log a lot).

Questions:
1. Which command did you like the most? 
2. In which cases it is better to use `git merge` and when `git rebase`?


### Task 3: Use your imagination

This task can be hard :).

Here I want you to do something using git that you think is interesting or cool or great.
**Anything**.

Maybe some complex commits copying, maybe some complex conflicts solving. Do the research. Use your brain. 

I'll be waiting.
