# Task 1: Solving conflicts

---

##### Subtask 1.1

I used ```myname.txt``` from previous task in branch ```hw-personal-data```. I created new branch ```hw-conflict``` and into it I changed ```myname.txt```. After that I switched to ```hw-personal-data``` and tried to merge it into ```hw-conflict```.
