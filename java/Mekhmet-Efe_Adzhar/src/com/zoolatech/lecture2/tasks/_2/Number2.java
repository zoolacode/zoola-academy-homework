/*Define a class that represents a robot, which moves in a room of a width W and a height of H.
The class should provide methods to move a robot forward by either 1 or N tiles and turn it either left or right
by 90 degrees from the current direction.
The class should also provide methods to get the robot's current location and direction.
The north-west corner of a room is represented by coordinates
(0,0); north-east - (W-1, 0); south-east - (W-1, H-1); south-west - (0, H-1).
By default, a robot should be placed in the north-west corner facing south direction.
However, it should be also possible to give any coordinates and direction as the initial
robot location. Robot must not be able to get outside of a room - in such case the robot should
move as much as possible to the room border, print a warning message and stop.
All next moves in the same direction should be prevented.
