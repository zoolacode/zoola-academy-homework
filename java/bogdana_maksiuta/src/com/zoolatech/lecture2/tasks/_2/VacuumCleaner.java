/**
 * Define a class that represents a robot, which moves in a room of a width W and a height of H.
 * The class should provide methods to move a robot forward by either 1 or N tiles and
 * turn it either left or right by 90 degrees from the current direction.
 * The class should also provide methods to get the robot's current location and direction.
 * The north-west corner of a room is represented by coordinates (0,0); north-east - (W-1, 0);
 * south-east - (W-1, H-1); south-west - (0, H-1).
 * By default, a robot should be placed in the north-west corner facing south direction.
 * However, it should be also possible to give any coordinates and direction as the initial robot location.
 * Robot must not be able to get outside of a room - in such case the robot should move as much as possible
 * to the room border, print a warning message and stop. All next moves in the same direction should be prevented.
