/**
 * Write a program that simulates the guess a number game.
 * The program should generate a random number between 1 and N
 * (N should be read from the input) and the user needs to guess it.
 * If the user enters a number less than guessed, the program needs to output “Larger”.
 * If the user enters a number greater than guessed - the program should output “Smaller”.
 * If the user guesses the number correctly - the program should output “That’s it!” and finish.
