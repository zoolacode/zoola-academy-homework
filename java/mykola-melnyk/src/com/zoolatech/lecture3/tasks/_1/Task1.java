/**
 * Design classes that represent an orchestra,
 * musicians and musical instruments (at least 3 different one).
 * Each instrument has a name and a method to print a unique sound
 * of the instrument. Each musician has a name and an associated
 * instrument which he plays. It should be possible to distinguish
 * two musicians. A musician should also have a method which should
 * print his/her name and the name of an instrument. Then it needs
 * to make the instrument sound. It should be possible to add/remove
 * musicians from/to the orchestra. When the add/remove action is
 * performed, the orchestra needs to print the action name + name
 * of the musician. The orchestra should also have a method which
 * commands all musicians to play the music. Inside of the main
 * method, create a couple of instances of all classes and play the music.
