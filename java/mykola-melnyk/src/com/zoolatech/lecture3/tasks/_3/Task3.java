/** Create a hierarchy of 3 classes: Circle, Triangle, Rectangle,
 * and a basic interface Shape that provides methods to find a
 * perimeter and an area for each shape.
 * In the main method, create a list of three objects and display
 * their perimeter and area. Then display the radius of a circle and lengths
 * of a triangle and rectangle sides for objects stored in the list.
 * Prevent other classes from extension from the Shape interface.
 * It should be also possible to check if two object references of these
 * types are the same and to print the inner state of an object
 * (like radius or width) to the console output when an object
 * is passed to the System.out.println method.
