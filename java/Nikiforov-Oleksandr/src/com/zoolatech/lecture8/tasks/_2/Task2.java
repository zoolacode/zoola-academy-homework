/**
 * Create a class ImageProcessorTask that accepts an image (represented as an int[][] array, where each item of
 * an array is an individual pixel) and applies some transformation to each pixel (your choice, e.g.,
 * multiplies it by 10). The class needs to recursively split the processing task into smaller subtasks (subimages),
 * and start processing of a subimage only if its width and height are <= 10 pixels. Note: you don’t need to create
 * a new subarray for each subtask, it’s enough to pass coordinates of its bounds. Each subtask should be processed
 * concurrently. Hint: the simplest way would be to split an image on each step to 4 quadrants.
 * Imagine that an initial image is just a big quadrant.
