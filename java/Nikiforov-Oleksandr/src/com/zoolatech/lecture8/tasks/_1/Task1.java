/**
 * Create a class Restaurant thatâ€™s able to accept orders from multiple customers (the order can just contain an id
 * and a customer name). The restaurant needs to have a couple of Chefs and DeliveryPerson.
 * The first available chef needs to pick up a new order and process it (the process can simply print an appropriate
 * message and sleep for a couple of seconds). When an order is ready, it should be passed to the first available
 * DeliveryPerson, which needs to deliver an order to a customer (also, just print an appropriate message and sleep
 * for some time). Use queues to synchronize order processing between customers, chefs and delivery persons.
 * Note: both chefs and delivery persons need to run in the separate thread.
