/**
 * Create a class Restaurant thatâ€™s able to accept orders from multiple customers (the order can just contain an id
 * and a customer name). The restaurant needs to have a couple of Chefs and DeliveryPerson. The first available chef
 * needs to pick up a new order and process it (the process can simply print an appropriate message and sleep for
 * a couple of seconds). When an order is ready, it should be passed to the first available DeliveryPerson,
 * which needs to deliver an order to a customer (also, just print an appropriate message and sleep for some time).
 * Use queues to synchronize order processing between customers, chefs and delivery persons. Note: both chefs and
 * delivery persons need to run in the separate thread.
