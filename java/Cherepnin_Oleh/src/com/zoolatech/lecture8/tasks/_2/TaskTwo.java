 * Create a class ImageProcessorTask that accepts an image (represented as an int[][] array, where each item

 * processing of a subimage only if its width and height are <= 10 pixels. Note: you don’t need to create a new
 * subarray for each subtask, it’s enough to pass coordinates of its bounds. Each subtask should be processed
 * concurrently. Hint: the simplest way would be to split an image on each step to 4 quadrants. Imagine that an
